# C8 AI Challenge

An insurance company needs to estimate the cost of vehicle damage.
The insurer submits an image of the damaged vehicle, and the system initially qualifies the severity of the damage.

Some keys that the system has to answer:
* What type of vehicle is it? (Car, Boat, or another category?)
* Is the damage minor (e.g., a small dent) or severe?


The principles are:
* A user submits a document. The document is uploaded in the Document handling of Camunda
* Because the Mistral connector accepts only URLs to access the Image, we need to store the document in a bucket accessible via an HTTP URL. Amazon S3 Bucket offers that. So, the second step consists of copying the document to the S3 Bucket
* The Mistral AI is called to check the Image and return information (type of vehicle, cost of damage)
* The User's coverage is retrieved. We will simulate that part and return a `basic` coverage
* Then, a DMN table is used to make the decision. In many situations, an approval or a rejection can be decided automatically
* If the decision is to be verified by humans, then we will redirect the request to a different team, according to the IA detected
* finally, the application is accepted or rejected

Via this scenario, different feature of Camunda 8 will be used
* Document handling: a user can upload a file in a form, and this document is saved in Camunda
* It's possible to manage this document to export it to a different container (S3 bucket here)
* an AI, Mistral, is integrated and works on the Image uploaded
* DMN table helps to automate some decision
* A user task can display the Image and check the result of the AI


You need, or you will create during this workshop

# 2. Build the Process

We will use AI Copilot to build the process incrementally during this step.


2.1 Go to the Modeler and create a new project. Name it `ClaimManagementProjet`
![Process_CreateProject.png](images/process/Process_CreateProject.png)

2.2 Create a new process. Name it `ClaimManagement`
![Process_CreateProcess.png](images/process/Process_CreateProcess.png)


2.3 Ask AI Copilot to generate a process using the following description:

```
A user submits a document. The first step is to call an AI service to analyze the document, identify the vehicle type, and estimate the damage cost. If the estimated cost is below $5,000, the application is automatically accepted, and reimbursement proceeds. If the cost exceeds this threshold, the case is assigned to a manual review task, where an operator can accept or reject the application.
```


2.4 According to the vehicle type, let's dispatch the human verification to three teams.

````
Before manual validation, a decision gateway that directs cases to different manual review tasks based on the vehicle type (Car, Boat, or Truck) should be introduced.
````

2.5 Add a new step, `Get Coverage`

```
After the analysis by the AI, add a service task to retrieve the coverage of the User in a variable "coverage". For the moment, simulate that task with a script task using FEEL.
```

2.6 Add a new step, `Upload to S3.`

Mistral accepts only an external URL, so a connector to upload the file to a public S3 bucket is necessary. At the end of the process, the file is purged from the S3 bucket.

```
We need to upload the file on a public URL for AI. Please add a service task with the connector AWS S3 before the analysis with AI.
```

2.7 Refining the Process by Adding a Decision Logic:

```
I changed my mind. After the coverage task, I want to add a call to a DMN table. The DMN table returns a status of "accepted," "verified," or "rejected," and the decision is made based on the status. Verify the lead to the gateway to select the team.
```

2.8 Purge the S3 file
```
Before the two end events, please add two service tasks using the AWS connector to delete the uploaded file.
```

2.9 Let's precise the rejection

```
When the application is rejected, a "reject" task is necessary just before the end event.
```

2.10 The Script task produces a variable `coverage,` and the value is hard-coded to `basic`.

![Process_CoverageScript.png](images/process/Process_CoverageScript.png)




2.11 The process is at the end:
![Process_designProcess.png](images/process/Process_designProcess.png)






# 3. Build the Submission Form

Users must submit damage reports using a form. The AI Copilot can assist in creating this form.

3.1 Click back on the project and create a new Form
![Form_SubmitApplication.png](images/form/Form_SubmitApplication.png)

3.2 Rename the form `ClaimSubmission`

![Form_ClaimSubmission.png](images/form/Form_ClaimSubmission.png)


3.3 AI Copilot Request:
```
Users can upload an image labeled 'damageImg', a description, and a comment.
The contract number in the URL parameter 'contractNo' should be displayed as a read-only text field.
```
![Form_AIGenerateSubmitApplication.png](images/form/Form_AIGenerateSubmitApplication.png)

3.4 The result is something like
![Form_SubmitApplicationForm.png](images/form/Form_SubmitApplicationForm.png)

3.5 Check fields and widgets are correctly set

| Field           | key         |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Contract Number | contractNo  |
| Description     | description |
| Comments        | comments    |
| Damage file     | damageImg   |


3.6 Click on the Connect to Diagram button





# 4. Build the Validation Form

This form will be used during the manual review step.

4.1 From the project, create a form and name it `ClaimVerification.`

![Form_ClaimVerification.png](images/form/Form_ClaimVerification.png)


4.2 AI Copilot Request:
```
In the validation form, display the stored document ('damageImg'). Also, show 'vehicleType' and 'estimateCost' as read-only fields. Include two buttons: 'Accepted' and 'Rejected', which update the process variable 'status'."
```

4.3 Additional Requirement:
```
Add a text field named 'comments' where the User can leave remarks. Save this as a document called 'comments'. (Verification needed if this is feasible.)"
```

4.4 Final result:
![Form_ClaimVerificationForm.png](images/form/Form_ClaimVerificationForm.png)

Check fields are correctly set.

| Field                 | key                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Image preview         | damageImg                  |
| Description           | description                |
| Comments              | comments                   |
| Vehicle Type          | vehiculeType               |
| Estimate Cost         | estimateCost               | 
| Analysis              | vehiculeDamageExplanation  | 
| Verification Comments | verificationsComment       |

![Edit Permission.png](images/AWSS3/S3_BucketEditPermission.png)

6.23 Give this JSON
````
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "*"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::bucket/*"
        //replace with bucket ARN ((replace bucket with the name of the bucket))
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

! Attention: you must change some information in your JSON.
1/ Change the AWS by the arn value. The arn is visible on the same screen under the label `Bucket ARN.`
2/ Change the resource, replacing `bucket` by it's name
3/Change the `Principal` / `AWS` to `"*"`

One result is

# 7. Configure the S3 Connector

7.1 In the process, go back to the `Upload Image to S3` connector and click to change the type of element
![Connector Select.png](images/S3Connector/S3Connector_Select.png)

7.2 Copy the Access key and the Secret key.
The bucket's region is accessible in AWS by clicking the search bar.
![img_9.png](images/S3Connector/S3Connector_RegionOfBucket.png)


7.3 We don't want to save the different keys in the process. Let's use the Secret mechanism. In the cluster, access the ConnectorSecret tabs
![Connector Secrets](S3Connector_Secrets.png)

7.4 Create the secret `S3AccessKey'and copy the key created in the AWS Account
![Accesskey](S3Connector_AccessKey.png)

7.5 Do the same for the `S3SecretKey`, the `S3Region`, and for the `S3BucketName.`
![All Secrets](S3Connector_S3AllSecrets.png)

There are different advantages:
* The secrets are not embedded in the process; you can share them without any concern
* if the process is deployed on a different server, different values may applied, pointing to a different environment

7.6 Reference the secrets in the connector

| parameter  | value                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Access key | {{secrets.S3AccessKey}}                          |
| secret key | {{secrets.S3SecretKey}}                          |
| region     | {{secrets.S3Region}}                             |
| action     | Upload object                                    |
| AWS bucket | {{secrets.S3BucketName}}                         |
| AWS key    | damageImg[1].metadata.fileName+"_"+string(now()) | 
| Document   | damageImg[1]                                     |

Note: The document is uploaded and tagged with the date. The idea is to have a unique name for each document on the S3 bucket.

As output

| parameter         | value                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------| 
| Result variable   | damageImgS3Img             |
| Result expression | { "damageS3ImgUrl": link}  |


The variable damageS3ImgUrl contains the direct URL to access the Image.
